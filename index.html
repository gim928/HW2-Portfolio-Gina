          Hello! My name is Gina Im and I am a full-stack developer. I have an
          undergraduate degree in biochemistry and a master's degree in civil
          and environmental engineering. I have conducted scientific research,
          worked as a structural field engineer, and conducted workplace
          accident and fatality investigations and I am registered as an
          engineer for the state of Colorado. Problem-solving and
          troubleshooting are second nature to me so naturally I was drawn to
          the tech industry. I love being immersed in solving a problem and
          building things!
