# HW2-Portfolio-Gina

## Gina Im's Initial Portfolio

### The objective of this project was to gain experience in creating a web application from scratch by building a portfolio page to showcase future work. An effective portolio is essential to a successful job search and therefore this exercise is extremely relevant to me as a prospective developer. CSS and HTML were used to build this web application, using skills such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. Accessibility was added to the application in the form of alt text and usage of semantic elements to describe functional areas of the site. Learning to create a web application from scratch and mastering the use of skills in CSS and HTML is valuable to me as a new developer breaking into the industry. I learned how to write and troubleshoot code without a template and gained more knowledge in CSS and HTML.
